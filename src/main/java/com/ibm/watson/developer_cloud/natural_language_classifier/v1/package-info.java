/**
 * The IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier service applies deep learning
 * techniques to make predictions about the best predefined classes for short
 * sentences or phrases. The classes can trigger a corresponding action in an
 * application, such as directing a request to a location or person, or
 * answering a question. After training, the service returns information for
 * texts that it hasn't seen before. The response includes the name of the top
 * classes and confidence values.
